# BART+BERT Ensemble ABSA Model for Indonesia Tourism Attraction Review

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for  final research project that combines BART and BERT models using the ensemble method. The main goal is to improve Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) model performance for the [Indonesia‚Äôs Tourism Destinations dataset](https://github.com/dian9395/dataset-gold-aspectbased-borobudur-prambanan) (Study case: Borobudur and Prambanan temples). 

## Proposed Model Description

![Proposed Model Architecture](img/proposed-model-arc.png)

### BART+BERT Ensemble Model
1. **Model Components**: We utilize a pretrained model BART<sub>LARGE</sub> model for BART and a BERT<sub>BASE</sub> Uncased model for BERT. These models are fine-tuned on the dataset for enhanced the performance.
2. **Ensemble Library**: The [ensemble transformers](https://github.com/jaketae/ensemble-transformers) library is employed to seamlessly combine the two models.
3. **Dataset**: The dataset used for fine-tuning can be found at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/dian9395/dataset-gold-aspectbased-borobudur-prambanan).

### Fine-Tuning and Customization
1. **Fine-Tuning**:
    - **BART**: Fine-tuned using the the dataset
    - **BERT**: Similarly, fine-tuned on the dataset
2. **Layer Modification**:
    - For each model (BART and BERT), the final layer (usually known as **head**) is modified by adding a **linear layer**.
    - The ensemble model predicts by averaging the class probabilities from both models.

### Model Interface
